# CameraX_Basics
A simple Android application created to gain a better understanding of how to use Kotlin to build Android apps. This application was also used to gain basic familiarity with the Android CameraX API.

The application implements basic camera permissions, image capture and storage, camera switching, a SharedViewModel for passing data between fragments, a Navigation Component with a nav_graph, support for screen orientation changes, and fullscreen mode.
